- Scripts had incorrect field names and configurations
- Target bundles were wrong or missing
- Field types didn't match documentation
- Missing shared field system implementation
- No user profile fields (to replace Profile content type)
- Missing media bundle field structure

### **Solutions Implemented** ✅

#### **2. Validation System Added**
**Decision**: Added comprehensive validation to ensure fields match documentation  
**Date**: Current Session  
**Files Created**:

## 📋 **Development Process & Decisions**

### **Confirmation Protocol**
- ✅ **Always request confirmation before starting any coding**
- ✅ **Document all decisions in README.md**  
- ✅ **Update documentation with each session's decisions**
- ✅ **Maintain clear decision history and rationale**

### **Recent Decisions Made**

### **Recent Decisions Made**

#### **Field Creation Fix - APPROVED & COMPLETED** ✅
**Date**: Current Session  
**Problem**: Wrong fields being created on install - scripts didn't match documentation  
**Decision**: Complete rewrite of all field creation scripts to exactly match "Drupal 11 Content types and fields.md"  
**Rationale**: 
- Scripts were creating incorrect field structures
- Missing shared fields system implementation
- Wrong target bundles and field types
- No user profile fields to replace Profile content type
- Critical for migration accuracy and data integrity

**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Completely rewrote `create-content-types-and-fields.php`
- ✅ Completely rewrote `create-media-bundles-and-fields.php`  
- ✅ Created new `create-user-profile-fields.php`
- ✅ Added comprehensive validation script
- ✅ All fields now match documentation exactly
- ✅ Shared fields system properly implemented
- ✅ Media bundles replace deprecated content types
- ✅ User profile fields replace Profile content type

#### **Permission Script Alignment - COMPLETED** ✅
**Date**: Current Session  
**Problem**: Permission script configured permissions for deprecated content types (audio, video, profiel, verslag)  
**Decision**: Completely rewrite setup-role-permissions.php to match actual D11 content types  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Removed deprecated content types from permissions (audio, video, profiel, verslag)
- ✅ Added missing content type permissions (webform)
- ✅ Updated field permissions to match D11 field structure
- ✅ Aligned all permissions with created content types and fields
- ✅ Added proper role hierarchy and access levels
- ✅ Removed references to non-existent D6 fields

**Rationale**: 
- Permission setup was trying to configure permissions for content types that don't exist in D11
- Field permissions referenced old D6 field names and structures
- Need exact alignment between created content/fields and configured permissions
- Critical for proper role-based access control in D11
**Date**: Current Session  
**Problem**: User roles were not being created, only permissions configured  
**Decision**: Create user roles creation script and integrate into setup process  
**Implementation Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- ✅ Created `create-user-roles.php` script with all 16 D6 roles
- ✅ Added user roles creation step to setup script (Step 8)
- ✅ Added user roles validation
- ✅ Updated permission setup to run AFTER roles exist (critical fix)
- ✅ Added --skip-userroles option for flexibility
- ✅ Created role validation script for verification

#### **User Roles Integration - COMPLETED** ✅
**Date**: Current Session  
**Problem**: User roles were not being created, only permissions configured

- ✅ Added user roles creation step to setup script (Step 8)
- ✅ Added user roles validation
- ✅ Updated permission setup to run AFTER roles exist (critical fix)
- ✅ Added --skip-userroles option for flexibility
- ✅ Created role validation script for verification

**Rationale**: 
- Permission setup was failing because roles didn't exist
- D6 roles need to be recreated in D11 for proper migration
- Role hierarchy and weights must be preserved
- Committee roles essential for content management workflow
**Date**: Current Session  
**Problem**: User profile fields script was not integrated into the setup process
